<p class="main">Japanese grammar is quite simple and straight
forward but very different from English grammar so most English
speakers find it rather confusing. For instance, in Japanese
grammar the verb always comes at the end. The best thing you can do
when learning Japanese grammar is to learn it from the bottom up
and not compare it to English grammar.<br>
<br>
Japanese grammar uses what we will refer to as particles to mark
the various parts of the sentence. The main Japanese particles are:
(These particles will be described in more detail below)</p>

<p class="main"><strong>The particles "wa" (は) and "ga"
(が):</strong> The particle "wa" marks the topic of the
sentence and the particle "ga" marks the subject of the sentence.
In the example, "I know where you live" (watashi <u>wa</u> anata
<u>ga</u> doko ni sunde iru ka shitte iru), "I" would be the topic
while "you" would be the subject.<br>
<br>
Not all Japanese sentences have both a topic and subject and, in
many cases, the topic is implied in Japanese (for example, the "I"
(watashi wa) would be left out of this sentence because it is
implied that since I am talking I am the one that knows where you
live). Many Japanese books and teachers teach that "wa" and "ga"
are the same thing and it doesn't matter which you use when. This
is not the case but I wouldn't worry too much about keeping them
straight at first - it will come with time.<br>
<br>
<strong>The particle "wo" (を):</strong> The particle "wo"
(or "o") marks the direct object of a Japanese sentence. In the
example, "I'm going to take her home" (watashi wa kanojo <u>wo</u>
ie ni okuru), "her" would be the direct object.<br>
<br>
<strong>The particle "ni" (に):</strong> The particle "ni"
can be used to mark the direction, time, or the indirect object of
a Japanese sentence.<br>
<br>
An example of a direction marker can be seen in the previous
example "I'm going to take her home" (watashi wa kanojo wo ie
<u>ni</u> okuru). In this case, the "ni" acts like a "to" - "I'm
going to take her 'to' home". The particle "e" (へ) can be
used in this way as well but usually implies more of a general
direction as opposed to a specific place.<br>
<br>
The particle "ni" is also used to mark time in a Japanese sentence.
For example, "I'm leaving at 3 o'clock" (watashi wa sanji <u>ni</u>
hanareru).<br>
<br>
The final use for the particle "ni" in Japanese grammar is that of
indirect object marker. In the example, "I was taken home by him"
(watashi wa kare <u>ni</u> ie made okurareta), "him" is the
indirect object.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The "watashi wa" in all of the example
sentences used above would normally be left out as it is
implied.</p>
